# Welcome to City 17.

Hi, I'm eros71, also known as eros744, I'm a beginner game (vocationally) and web developer (professionally).

I also know some Java, PHP, SQL (and HTML, CSS, JS, the usual web things).
I also make original music as a hobby (and hopefully one day as a job, still working on that, since it's my main passion) and some other Mario-related stuff as well.

Contributed along with the other pals in Xeno Butchers. (https://xenobutchers.itch.io/xeno-butchers)

I had some stats here before but you know what, have a smiley face instead.
